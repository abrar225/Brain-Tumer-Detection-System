A deep learning web application that classifies brain tumors from MRI scans into four categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, or no tumor.

## Features

- 🧠 CNN-based classification model (91% accuracy)
- 🌐 User-friendly Flask web interface
- 📊 Confidence percentage for predictions
- 🖼️ Image preview of uploaded scans
- 🚀 Ready for deployment

## Dataset

The model was trained on the [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset) containing:
- 3,072 training images
- 768 validation images
- 4 classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, no tumor

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-detection.git
cd brain-tumor-detection

pip install -r requirements.txt
wget https://your-model-host.com/model.h5 -O models/model.h5
python main.py

### Key Features of This README:
1. **Clear badges** showing tech stack
2. **Visual hierarchy** with emojis and sections
3. **Step-by-step** installation instructions
4. **Complete** project structure
5. **Training instructions** for custom models
6. **Responsive** design (looks good on GitHub mobile)

### Recommended Additions:
1. Add screenshots of your web interface in a `/screenshots` folder
2. Include a `requirements.txt` with all dependencies
3. Add a demo GIF showing the interface in action
4. For deployment, add sections for:
   - Docker setup
   - Cloud deployment (Heroku/AWS)
   - API documentation

Would you like me to:
1. Add specific deployment instructions?
2. Include sample API curl commands?
3. Create a more detailed contributing guide?
